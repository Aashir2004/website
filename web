                            gained."
                            The youthful Elric brothers, Edward and Alphonse, first became aware of this Law of
                            Equivalent Exchange after trying human transmutation, the one prohibited act of alchemy,
                            which is governed by it. Edward loses his left leg as a result of their sin, while Alphonse
                            loses his physical body. The only way Edward is able to attach Alphonse's soul to a set of
                            armour is through the desperate sacrifice of his right arm. Devastated and alone, Edward is
                            inspired to acquire metal limbs known as "automail" and become a state alchemist, the
                            Fullmetal Alchemist. He is motivated by the belief that they would both someday return to
                            their natural bodies.
                            After three years of looking, the brothers are still looking for the Philosopher's Stone, a
                            fabled artefact that enables an alchemist to break the Law of Equivalent Exchange. The
                            brothers become involved in a national conspiracy that leads them to the true nature of the
                            elusive Philosopher's Stone as well as their nation's murky history, despite having military
                            allies Colonel Roy Mustang, Lieutenant Riza Hawkeye, and Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes on
                            their side. Edward and Alphonse must decide whether their actions will restore their
                            humanity or take it away.</div>

                                    with Japan as its target. Thanks to Britannia's use of new mobile humanoid armour
                                    vehicles known as Knightmare Frames, operations were finished in one month. Japan's
                                    rights and identity were taken away, and the formerly proud country is now known as
                                    Area 11. While the Britannian elite lives well in their communities, its residents,
                                    known as Elevens, are forced to eke out an existence. Area 11 contains small pockets
                                    of opposition that support Japan's independence.<br>

                                    country. Lelouch acquires his Geass, or the power of the king, through a fortuitous
                                    encounter with a mysterious female named C.C. Lelouch may finally succeed in his

                                    The lab workers immediately encounter a series of strange occurrences that
                                    eventually lead to a pivotal discovery: the Phone Microwave has the ability to send
                                    emails into the past and so change history. The highly acclaimed graphic novel

                                    enjoyment rather than as a means of subsisting. A small portion of mankind managed
                                    to live by barricading themselves inside a city enclosed by walls that were even
                                    higher than the tallest of titans.<br>
                                    In the current, the city has not seen a titan in more than a century. A gigantic

                                    in order to learn more about life. Ryuk, a bored Shinigami and the God of Death,
                                    accidentally drops a Death Note giving Light instant control over both life and
                                    death. Light sets out to purge the world of evil—specifically, the individuals he
                                    considers to be evil—determined to make the best use of this awful gift. Should
                                    anyone possess such authority?</div>

                                <div>High school student Taiju Ooki, who has been holding affections for Yuzuriha Ogawa
                                    for five years, is now prepared to profess his love to her. However, just as Taiju
                                    starts to confess, a bright green light envelops the planet, terrifying everyone on
                                    it and turning them all into stone.<br>
                                    A few millennia later, when Taiju awakens, he discovers that the modern period has
                                    totally vanished and that nature has regenerated during the time that people were
                                    silent. Taiju only comes across one other living person in the stone world of
                                    statues: his science-obsessed friend Senkuu, who has been active for a few months.
                                    Taiju discovers Senkuu's ambitious plan to use science to bring in a total
                                    restoration of civilisation. Together, Taiju's strength and Senkuu's intelligence
                                    form a strong team that quickly discovers a way to resuscitate the petrified.<br>
                                    However, when his ideals are contested by those who awaken, Senkuu's grand scheme is
                                    put in jeopardy. The cause of humanity's petrification is still a mystery.</div>
